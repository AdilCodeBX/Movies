- **Bio**:
- Sarah Johnson is a 28-year-old movie enthusiast who works as a marketing
  manager in a medium-sized company. In her free time, she loves watching movies
  from various genres and eras. She prefers to stream movies online rather than
  going to theaters.

- **Needs/Goals**:
- Sarah wants to easily search for movies based on specific criteria such as
  title, genre, actors, or release year. She seeks a user-friendly interface
  that provides accurate search results and detailed information about each
  movie. Additionally, she values the ability to save her favorite movies for
  future reference.

- **Frustrations**:

- Sarah finds it frustrating when she can't quickly find a movie she wants to
  watch due to limited search options or inaccurate search results. She also
  dislikes websites with cluttered interfaces or intrusive advertisements that
  distract from the movie-searching experience.

- **Scenario 1**:
- Sarah heard about a new movie that she wants to watch but can't remember the
  title. She visits the movie website and uses the search bar to enter keywords
  related to the plot and cast. Within seconds, the website displays a list of
  relevant search results, allowing Sarah to identify the movie she was looking
  for and read more about it.
